### Failed Test
The tests will show specific error messages and exit with code 1 if any functionality fails.

## Usage Examples

```bash
# Test against Railway deployment
node test-full-game.js

# Test against local development server
SERVER_URL=http://localhost:3000 node test-full-game.js

# Test specific game code as player
node test-player.js https://showdown1-production.up.railway.app DEMO1234 MyNickname

# Test host functionality only
node test-host.js https://showdown1-production.up.railway.app
```

## Troubleshooting

If tests fail, check:
1. Server is running and accessible
2. Socket.IO is properly configured
3. CORS settings allow your test environment
4. Database connectivity (if using Prisma)
5. Network connectivity to the server

The test scripts include detailed logging to help diagnose issues.
